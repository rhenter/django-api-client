Welcome to Django API Client documentation!
===========================================

Django API Client is a client for APIs in general, which allows iterating with the API as if they were using a Local model in their project, through a client and Custom CBV (Class based Views)


Some reasons to use the **Django API Client**

* If you work with microservices with APIs in multiple locations and want to continue using Django as a WebApp with the same capabilities to render data as if you were using native models

* You want to separate your Django project to let one of them only with the API with DRF and the other as a WebApp with Templates (HTML), CSS, JS instead of using some JS frontend (ReactJS, AngularJS, etc.)

* You want to use a third party API to list, create and change using the django template system
